# TAILWIND MULTI CLASS

Easy, performant and versatile way to write tailwind classes in multiples lines, either as strings or as object with keys as tailwind variants.

Rules: 
 - Expresions have to be written between parentheses.
 - Cant use ternaries after ternaries (A ? B ? C : D).
 - Ternaries must return strings in both cases.
